Version naming
=====
The version naming of my plugin will follow this standard

Version A.B.C
* A = Major version (A complete revamp of the code)
* B = Minor version (Added a few functionalities)
* C = Bugfix (very minor edit)
* Any plugin I consider it not finished yet, I put the "major version" started from 0.
* Any plugin I consider it not finished yet, I put the "minor version" started from 1.
* Example: v0.1.0 (This does not mean I have completed 10% of the plugin, but it's the first version of the WIP plugin)
* This may goes even further, like v0.12.1
* Once I considered it's finished. I reset the minor version and up the major version to v1.0.0
* If I made a small changes such as bugfix, I increase it to v1.0.1
* If I end up adding more functionality, I increase it to v1.1.0 while resetting the later number.
