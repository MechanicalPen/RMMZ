Currently, this repository is for my code dump at the moment. I can not guarantee the stability any of the plugins. If you decide to use one, use it at your own risk.

Plugins on the Sandbox folder are not ready to use (I use it mostly for backup). But you're free to look at it.

Version naming
=====
The version naming of my plugin will follow this standard

Version A.B.C
* A = Major version (A complete revamp of the code)
* B = Minor version (Added a few functionalities)
* C = Bugfix (very minor edit)
* Any plugin I consider it not finished yet, I put the "major version" started from 0.
* Any plugin I consider it not finished yet, I put the "minor version" started from 1.
* Example: v0.1.0 (This does not mean I have completed 10% of the plugin, but it's the first version of the WIP plugin)
* This may goes even further, like v0.12.1
* Once I considered it's finished. I reset the minor version and up the major version to v1.0.0
* If I made a small changes such as bugfix, I increase it to v1.0.1
* If I end up adding more functionality, I increase it to v1.1.0 while resetting the later number.
